# The Duke as a web app

This is a web app version of the board game "The Duke" as created by [Catalyst Games](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/casual-games/the-duke/)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brianyamasaki/duke-game.git
cd duke-game
yarn
```

## Get started

```bash
yarn start
```

This boilerplate is built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you will want to read their User Guide for more goodies.

## Project Status

The project is basically playable, where most basic tiles are created and move rules are supported. Currently it's only playing inside a single browser and players must click the End of Turn to allow the other player to move. 

## Not supported yet
We don't support the Mountain or Flag tiles or rules for those pieces. In addition, tile support will get better over time.

## Long term goals

* Support playing 1 on 1 play with player matching services on the server
* Dynamic creation of tiles using existing rules.
* Touch screen support
* improved mobile phone support
